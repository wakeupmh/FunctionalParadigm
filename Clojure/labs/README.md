## In Clojure

Functions are **"things"** is the informal way of saying that here in Clojure functions are treated as something very important, as important as data. 

That is, you can work with symbols that reference functions. Functions are **"first class citizens".** 

You can even pass them as arguments to other functions, 
or receive them as function returns.
 
 Functions that receive or return functions are called **"higher order functions"**.
